		Of Our Hotel
		</h1>
		<p>
		Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels
		in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western 
		Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up
		in the later part of the 19th century.
